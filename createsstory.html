        There was once a boy, far above east, herding a den of sheep, protecting it from any danger.
         The boy lived right next to tolsken, a small town with a tightly closed community. One day 
        as some sort of a joke he decides to go into town calling danger had come upon his sheep, and in an instance the pople of tolsken respond with quickness. 
        But Once they go to the sheep and saw all was well. 
            <div class ="col">
        The people disgruntled warned him about falsely saying things, but as time passed the boy decided to partake 
        in the joke again, and again the people came to his aid. He repeated the joke, again and again and again. Until, One summer day, from the bushes, watching it's prey,
        waiting for the right moment, a wolf, looking for its next meal. Out of the glimmer of the sun, the boy spotted the wolf, he ran into town crying, but the people  of tolsken 
        became deaf to his cries. He ran back into the pastures, deciding to doing any measure in protecting his herd, but the wolf had already left with his prey. \</div>

                <p> Cars were invented in 1886, when German inventor Carl Benz patented his Benz Patent-Motorwagen.[3][4][5] Cars became widely available during the 20th century. One of the first cars affordable by the masses was the 1908 Model T, an American car manufactured by the Ford Motor Company. Cars were rapidly adopted in the US, where they replaced horse-drawn carriages.[6] In Europe and other parts of the world, demand for automobiles did not increase until after World War II.[7] The car is considered an essential part of the developed economy.
