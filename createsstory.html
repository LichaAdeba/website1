        But Once they go to the sheep and saw all was well. The people disgruntled warned him about falsely saying things, but as time passed the boy decided to partake 
        in the joke again, and again the people came to his aid. He repeated the joke, again and again and again. Until, One summer day, from the bushes, watching it's prey,
        waiting for the right moment, a wolf, looking for its next meal. Out of the glimmer of the sun, the boy spotted the wolf, he ran into town crying, but the people  of tolsken 
        became deaf to his cries. He ran back into the pastures, deciding to doing any measure in protecting his herd, but the wolf had already left with his prey.
